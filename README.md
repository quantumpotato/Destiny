Destiny

Carddriven improvisational role playing game by quantumpotato.

Inspired by Luck of the Draw at Chattanooga State University.
Special thanks to the Knowles family and avocado farmers everywhere.

Summary

Everything - characters, events, world conditions, conflicts, resolutions and transitions are decided by the players and their cards. There is no GM. Everyone will play multiple characters. 

Every character is played pining to accomplish their Objective and fulfil their Destiny. The latter may be unknown or unconscious to the character. 

Players in Destiny fill out a series of categorized cards before play starts.
Cards are shuffled then players use those cards to mentally form a character in their heads.
During play, players may interject one of their cards to change the plot.
Great Fun comes from everyone adapting to the change in circumstances.

Rules of Play

FIRST DRAW:

Everyone fills out cards detailed in the Sequence steps below. Everyone may keep up to 3 of their own cards. Take the rest, organize by type and shuffle. Redistribute. Take 5 minutes to generate a character in your head based on the 17 character cards in your hand.

CIRCLE RULE:
Play takes place in rotation AROUND a circle. First player has a chance to speak or play a card, then the second, etc. Interrupt only when it makes sense and cease talking if everyone glowers at you for acting out of turn. When it's not your turn, stay quiet and plan your next maneuver. If you have nothing to say, point, tap or nod to give an indication of your pass. Turns go by very quickly.

ACT TRANSITION RULE:
3 Acts (or agree on a number) total. Try to resolve more questions than you create in the final act.

The player who suggested you play Destiny is the first player. They get a Transition Token placed in front of them (pick something). Their primary character is in the first scene. The scene ends when and how they say it does. 

When the scene ends, they pass the Transition Token to a side of their choosing. The next scene ends when that player decides and the token continues in the same direction. When the token reaches all the way back around, one final scene is played and then an intermission occurs.

INVOLVEMENT RULE:

Everyone who wants to be involved in a scene is involved in a scene. Players who do not wish to play their primary may play their secondary or invent a tertiary to fit into the scene. Tertiary characters exist to keep the story moving. Sleepless check-out clerks, birdwatchers, insurance saleswomen, etc. Tertiary characters require only a minimum of three character cards to be generated.

INTERMISSION RULE:
Between acts, everyone fills out more cards based on the story so far. Again, players may keep up to 3 then reshuffle and redistribute as per First Draw. 

No new primary or secondary characters are created unless an existing one took a permanent stage exit and everyone agrees on creating a new one. Remember that even if your primary gets vaporized or takes a vacation you can still play as secondary and tertiary characters.

VIOLENCE RULE:
I have no idea how to handle the execution of violent agency, dodging, hitting, missing and the resolution of uncertain results. Yet. I'm thinking of some kind of bidding system combined with a dice roll, though.

Sequence of Events:
-Fill out cards {}
-Shuffle
-Each player creates one main character in their head
-Secondary characters will be created during play by a player who does not have a primary character in the scene. Secondary characters are created with cards like primary characters are but are not tied to that player. After the scene, that character's cards are placed down and any player can pick them up in a later scene.


NOTES:

-Tertiary characters may evolve into secondary or primary characters if the group 100% agrees. This usually won't happen until the tertiary character has developed through several scenes or even game to game.
-A notebook and writing utensil is recommended for everyone.
-Secret note passing is not acceptacle. Conspiring with other players in intermissions is.
-The CIRCLE RULE is very important. Keep the story flowing smoothly by talking only on your turn. Nod your head, point your finger or give some other quick tell to pass your turn.
-Play happens quickly. Stay on your toes and have fun!

Character Cards

Character cards define the heart, mind and body of a character. A primary character requires all of these to be generated. A secondary character requires 9 and a tertiary requires 3.

More character cards may be played during play to develop a character you are playing.

Organize the cards in separate hands in front of you so you can keep track of which cards make up which characters.

-Connection
   A relationship to another character. You can define bits about the other character. Eg. 'had drunken sex one night', 'robbed me five years ago', 'advanced their career through my wise advice'.
-Secret historical event
  Something in the past the character observed or was directly a part of which most people outside of the event don't know about. Eg. 'assassination attempt', 'software backdoor installation', 'intercepted suspicious radio signals from ocean'
-Objective
  A personal or professional goal. Eg. 'oney to move out of this shithole', 'recovering a stolen car', 'collect rich person's blood sample from hospital'
-Preparation
  An incidence of planning ahead. 'secret weapons cache', '"if you're reading this letter" arrangements', 'key to ex lover's house'
-Distinguishing appearance factor
  Something other characters can recognize you easily by. Eg. 'scar across cheek', 'left leg limp', 'sunburned skin'
-Psychology
  A personal belief system that motivates behavior. Eg. 'misogyny stemming from mother issues', 'kleptomania because property is an outdated belief system', 'help others before they want to hurt you'
-Blind spot
  Something the character is just a little bit dense about or refuses to see the light on. Eg. 'my ex-employer has only the best out for me', 'I'm going to get that money back', 'when I saw those tears I knew they were telling the truth'

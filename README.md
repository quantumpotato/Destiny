Inspired by Luck of the Draw and Chattanooga State University's (avocados).

Players in Repose fill out a series of cards before play starts.
Cards are shuffled then players use those cards to mentally form a character in their heads.
During play, players may interject one of their cards to change the plot.
Great Fun comes from everyone adapting to the change in circumstances.

Sequence of Events:
-Fill out cards {}
-Shuffle
-Each player creates one main character in their head
-Secondary characters will be created during play by a player who does not have a primary character in the scene. Secondary characters are created with cards like primary characters are but are not tied to that player. After the scene, that character's cards are placed down and any player can pick them up in a later scene.
-Tertiary characters will be played by whomever doesn't have a primary character in a scene. These characters do not require cards. Tertiary characters may evolve into secondary or primary characters if the group 100% agrees. This usually won't happen until the tertiary character has developed through several scenes or even game to game.
